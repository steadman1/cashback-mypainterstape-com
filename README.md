# Source Code for the Ponder Portfolio

Ponder, an iOS Lucid Dream Journal app, has been a side project of mine for the better part of a year and a half. After completing the UI design mockups in Figma in the summer of 2023, finishing this project has been a constant battle of finding free time in my college schedule (in a good way, though (?)). However, I'm proud to finally have a working version of Ponder to show for my effort.

I hope you enjoy [the website](https://ponder.mypainterstape.com) and check out the app!
